This website aims to disseminate the data of the Barcelona 2030 Agenda online, so that this information reaches the interested public in the most complete, updated, standardized and reusable way possible. It is an exercise in transparency that should allow for better monitoring and evaluation of the degree of achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals in the city of Barcelona.

The data and metadata of the SDG targetâ€™s key indicators of the Barcelona 2030 Agenda are published through the OpenSDG solution. OpenSDG is an open source-based platform, specifically designed to manage and publish data and statistics related to the SDGs. It is built exclusively with open source tools and libraries and can be hosted and maintained using free services.

Likewise, the data sets are disseminated in fully compatible formats for subsequent publication on the [Barcelona Open Data portal](https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/en)

You can access the highlights of the OpenSDG platform in the following [Guide](https://open-sdg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quick-start/). The [Center for Open Data Enterprise (CODE)](https://www.opendataenterprise.org/) also offers support tools for the development and promotion of open data applications.

For any queries or clarifications about this website or the published data, you can contact us at  <a href="mailto:{{site.email_contacts.questions}}">{{site.email_contacts.questions}}</a>. You can also look for the answer in the [FAQ]({{ site.baseurl }}/faq/) section.
