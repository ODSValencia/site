## Can I make suggestions regarding new or different data sources?
If you have any comments regarding the data sources used, or any suggestions regarding the use of new data sources, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:{{site.email_contacts.questions}}">{{site.email_contacts.questions}}</a>.

## What does "Indicator status" mean?
For each indicator, its status is defined in one of the following four categories:

* **Reported online** – The operational SDG target has been defined and the indicator is available at city level, despite the fact that the data may not be completely disaggregated or pending updating.
* **Statistics in progress** – The operational target has been defined and the data source of the indicator identified, but the data is not yet available.
* **Exploring data sources** – Either the operational goal has not been defined, or it has been, but it has not been possible to identify an adequate data source to develop the corresponding indicator.
* **Not applicable** – The 17 SDGs of the 2030 Agenda are deployed in 169 targets, but not all of them have a translation at local level. In these cases, the label "Not applicable" is used.

In the event of adding fresh information to the status of an indicator or to data collection, this will be highlighted in the header of the indicator page.

## How often will the data be updated on the web?
It should be noted that the data sources that feed the indicators have very different origins, calendars and periodicities. The indicators are updated individually as new information becomes available.

## What can be done to avoid the lack of data or the little disaggregation provided?
There are indicators that are available at national, regional, provincial or metropolitan level, but not at the level of the core city.

This implies continuing to work on the search or creation of new data sources to solve this problem.

## How accessible is this website?

## Which browsers can I use to visit this website?
Any of the latest versions of commonly used browsers can be used.

Yes. This website has been built and hosted using 100% free software. Therefore, other cities can freely reuse its code. You can check out the highlights of the OpenSDG platform in the following [Guide](https://open-sdg.readthedocs.io).The [Center for Open Data Enterprise (CODE)](http://www.opendataenterprise.org/) also offers support tools for the development and promotion of open data applications.
